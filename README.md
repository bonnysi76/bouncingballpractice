## Component Details

### BouncingBall.js

This component encapsulates the bouncing ball animation. The structure is simple, focusing on the presentation layer.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './BouncingBall.css';

const BouncingBall = () => {
  return (
    <div className="ball-container">
      <div className="ball"></div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default BouncingBall;
```

### BouncingBall.css

The CSS file defines the animation using keyframes and styles the ball. The main classes include:

- `.ball-container`: Centers the ball within the viewport.
- `.ball`: Applies styling and animation to the ball.

```css
.ball-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: flex-end;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: #282c34;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.ball {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: #61dafb;
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: bounce 0.6s infinite alternate;
}

@keyframes bounce {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(-200px);
  }
}
```

### App.js

The main application component that renders the `BouncingBall` component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import BouncingBall from './BouncingBall';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <BouncingBall />
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### index.js

The entry point of the application, responsible for rendering the main `App` component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundational example of using React for animations, integrating CSS for visual effects, and structuring a React application. Feel free to modify the styles and animation parameters to create your unique effects!
